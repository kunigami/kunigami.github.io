# Virtual Museum

Welcome to my personal virtual museum.

This page links to a collection of different types of things I find interesting in particular in art (all forms: painting, sculture, architecture, etc.). It's an attempt to strengthen memories of experiences and an opportunity to learn more about them.

I try to organize them by country, even though this might not be accurate. Pages are organized by classes of works of art, not for specific artists. For example, I would have a page *Impressionism* but not a dedicated page for Monet.

As an exception, I might list individual works of art or artifacts if they have particular historical significance, e.g. the *Rosetta Stone*.
