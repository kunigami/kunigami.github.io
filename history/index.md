# Notes on History 

I enjoy reading about history, but since I tend to [forget about things](https://www.kuniga.me/blog/2022/12/27/on-memory.html), I'll write down some notes here, hoping to remember them better, have a place for a quick refresher or at least as a registry to the fact that at some point I knew them.

I'm not entirely settled on how to organize the notes, but chronologically seems reasonable. Doing it per country might not cut it because many countries today were not always so. The downside of chronological is that a topic might span a long period of time, so I'll use the start time as their chronological entry. I've been thinking for a long time of a good way to visualize spatial (regions in the world map) and chronological (time intervals) data in an intuitive way.

Another question is how or whether to nest events. By keeping everything flat, it provides an interesting perspective of contemporary events in the world, but it makes it hard to understand the bigger picture and the relationship of minor events as part of major ones.

I plan to use bullet points as opposed to prose, to keep things concise. I'll link to books where I learned about them when applicable.
