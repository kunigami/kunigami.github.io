# Notes on History 

I enjoy reading about history, but since I tend to [forget about things](https://www.kuniga.me/blog/2022/12/27/on-memory.html), I'll write down some notes here, hoping to remember them better, have a place for a quick refresher or at least as a registry to the fact that at some point I knew them.

I'm not entired settled on how to organize the notes, but chronologically seems reasonable. Doing it per country might not cut it because many countries today were not always so. The downside of chronological is that a topic might span a long period of time, so I'll use the start time as their chronological entry. I've been thinking for a long time of a good way to visualize spatial (regions in the world map) and chronological (time intervals) data in an intuitive way.


I plan to use bullet points as opposed to prose, to keep things concise. I'll link to books where I learned about them when applicable.

* 431-404BC: Peloponnesian War [3], the war between Athens and an alliance of states in the Peloponnese, centered around Sparta.
* 1171–1260: Ayyubid dynasty [4]
  * 1174–1193: Saladin was the founder of the Ayyubid dynasty.
* 1169–1254: Ayyubid–Crusader conflicts
  * 1187: Battle of Hattin [4], took place in near the village of Hittin (today Tiberias). Saladin defeated the Crusaders, re-captured Jerusalem and other cities held by Christians in the Levant. This prompted the third Crusade.
  * 1191: Battle of Arsuf [4], a battle between the Crusaders (third Crusade), led by  Richard I of England, and Ayyubid Sultanate, led by Saladin, with the victory of the former.
  * 1192: Battle of Jaffa [4], followed the Battle of Arsuf. Ended with a truce between the Crusaders and Saladin (treaty of Jaffa).
* 1526-1857: Mughal Empire [1]
  * 1526–1530: Babur was the founder of the empire and descendant of Timur (father's side) and Genghis Khan (mother's side). Originally from Central Asia, he invaded India through the Khyber pass in Afghanistan.
  * 1530–1556: Humayun was Babur's son. Lived in exile in Persia and forged alliances with the Safavid dynasty, which established Persian cultural influence in Mughal India. Humayun's Tomb built in 1570 is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in New Delhi.
  * 1556–1605: Akbar was Humayun's son. He expanded the empire considerably. The capital of his reign was in Fatehpur Sikri, which one can visit today near Agra. Akbar was a religious pluralist.
  * 1605–1627: Jahangir was Akbar's son. Neglected his duties as a ruler. As opposed to his father, Jahangir favored Islam.
  * 1628–1658: Shah Jahan was Jahangir's third son. He's particularly known for the buildings he left behind, including the Taj Mahal and the Red Fort (Shahjahanabad), and also the Peacock Throne.
  * 1658–1707: Aurangzeb was Shah Jahan's second son but he seized the throne from the eldest Dara Shikoh. He expanded the empire through Southern India and among his conquests includes the kingdom of Golconda (Hyderabad). Golconda was the last kindom to fall, thanks in part to the Golconda fort which can be visited today. After Aurangzeb the Mughal empire entered its decline phase.
  * 1707-1712: Bahadur Shah I was Aurangzeb son. His reign was cut short by his death. This also left a power gap in which different rulers attempt to control the empure.
  * 1712-1713: Jahandar Shah was Bahadur Shah I's son. He was made emperor by Zulfiqar Khan, the de facto ruler during the time.
  * 1713-1719: Farrukhsiyar was Bahadur Shah I's grandson (son of Azim-ush-Shan). He deposed his uncle Jahandar but was also a puppet of others, in this case the Sayyid brother.
  * 1719-1748: Muhammad Shah was Bahadur Shah I's son and he regained control of the empire from the Sayyid brothers.
  * 1738-1740: With the decline of Mughal power, Nader Shah Afshar from Iran invaded India and sacked Delhi, looting treasures like the Peacock throne and the Koh-i-Noor diamond.
  * 1837–1857: Bahadur Shah II was the last Mughal [2]. 
  * 1857: The Indian Rebellion of 1857 was an uprising against the British East India Company [2]. It marks the end of the Mughal Empire and the start of the British Raj.
