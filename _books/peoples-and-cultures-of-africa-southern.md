This coffe table book was useful to get a glimpse of the different cultures in Southern Africa, including countries I visited like Botswana, South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe.

The division of Africa into subregions is a bit arbitrary, especially near the borders. This book includes Madagascar, Mozambique and Zimbabwe which are not included in the United Nations scheme.

Some cultures were particularly relevant for my trip to Southern Africa and books I read about it in [2024]({{blog}}/2025/01/01/2024-in-review.html). South Africa trip: Afrikaners (Dutch settlers in South Africa and Namibia), Cape Malays (Indonesian and Malaysian brough in by the Dutch to Cape Town). Namibia trip: Herero, Himba, San. Long Walk to Freedom book: Indian South Africans, Xhosa (Nelson Mandela). An Arid Eden book: Ndebele and Shona (Zimbabwe), Tswana (Botswana).

Rating: 4/5.
