In Portuguese. It translates to <i>1499: Brazil before Cabral</i>. Pedro √Ålvares Cabral was the Portuguese navigator who discovered Brazil in 1500. The 1499 alludes to the focus of the book on history prior to that. It discusses archeological sites in Brazil. In these sites there are fossils of extinct animals such as the gliptodonte (a giant armadillo). Some other sites include remaints from Native populations such as mounds. One of the most interesting is the Marajoara culture, found in the nothern part of Brazil, with distinctive pottery.

This is a lightweight read but I found the language too colloquial to me. I get that it's trying to be accessible, but I found it often got in the way. Nevertheless, I learned quite a bit, since Pre-columbian history wasn't taught during my school days.

Rating: 4/5
