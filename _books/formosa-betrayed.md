This book covers a much narrower period of Taiwan's history than [A New Illustrated History of Taiwan]({{books}}/a-new-illustrated-history-of-taiwan), by Wan-yao Chou: the first few years of the ROC administration. Kerr was a United States diplomat and witnessed first hand those years. He is very critical of the KMT, especially of Chen Yi, the first governor of Taiwan.

I found the book overall boring, and I was disappointed because I really liked his book *Okinawa: The History of an Island People*.

Rating: 4/5
