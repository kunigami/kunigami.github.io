According to Aron, "highly senstivity" is distinct from introversion, but there's a high correlation. The key trait of sensitive people are that they notice things others don't.

The premise is similar to the book Quite by Susan Cain, to find unique advantages of a trait that is often considered a negative (introversion in Cain's case, sensitivity in Aron's).

The book has several questionnaires to help decided whether you're a highly sensitive person. My score says I am, no surprises, though some of the questions feel like horoscope: "I have a rich inner life (Y/N)" - this is so vague and prone to self-bias, who would answer no to this?

Other chapters of the book cover how to deal with relationships, at work and how to deal with trauma.

I got this book as a gift.

Rating: 3/5.
