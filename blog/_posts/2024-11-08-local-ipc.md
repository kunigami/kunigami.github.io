In this post we'll explore different ways to communicate between two processes when they're running on the same host.

## Pipes

A pipe is a one-way communication channel between a source process and a destination process. One big limitation is that it relies on file descriptors to communicate.

The problem is that processes don't share file descriptors by default. One exception is when a process creates a child process via `fork()`, in which case the child inherits the file descriptors from the parent.

TODO: Linux `pidfd_getfd()`

## FIFO

A FIFO is also known as a named pipe. The reason is that it can be identified by an alias (a name) between two unrelated processes.

The downside of FIFOs is that they're actually written to a file.

## Message Queue

* Priority queue
* Bi-directional
* Doesn't get consumed by default

## Shared Memory Segments

Without serialization

TODO: Example

## Memory Mapped Files

Memory backed by a file.

## Unix Domain Sockets

## Comparison Table

Dimensions:

* Bi-directional?
* In memory?
* Persistent?
