I was in Buenos Aires for work last week. I didn't have a chance to see much of the city because I only had time to do some sightseeing on the last day. Anyway, this post will be a brief record of my experiences in Argentina.

## Transportation

The buses are very cheap, as they seem to be subsidized by the government. Unlike Brazil, you pay an amount proportional to the distance to your destination. But even in the most expensive case, I don't think it reaches 2 pesos. Also, only coins are accepted as payment.

For those close to the center, the metro (known as *subte*) is a good option, costing 2.50 pesos. Line A is particularly curious due to its wooden carriages.

Taxis are not very expensive. I used this option between the airport and hotel. By the way, the number of taxis is very large compared to the number of private vehicles. Just be careful with shady taxi drivers trying to overcharge tourists.

## Food

From a gastronomic point of view, I had recommendations to try the *bife de chorizo* and *bife de lomo*, and I liked them a lot. I also had the privilege of attending a typical Argentinian barbecue (*asado*) in my co-worker's place. Unlike here (at least in São Paulo), the barbecue is done on a lower heat, letting the meat roast for a longer time, resulting in a softer texture.

## Places

On the day tour, I visited some famous places like Casa Rosada, Catedral Metropolitana, the Puerto Madero neighborhood, and the Boca neighborhood including the Boca Juniors stadium and *El Caminito*.

## Other activities

During the week my co-worker also took me to a tango show and we played a sport *padél*, which is a more lightweight version of tennis, with a smaller court and wooden rackets. I had never heard of it, but according to Wikipedia it is the second most popular sport in Argentina!

## Conclusion

Some impressions: I found the sidewalks too narrow, at least in the central part of the city. I found it curious that some bars have delivery men to take the coffee on a tray to nearby offices. The Argentineans I met at work are very polite and welcoming.

I missed knowing how to speak Spanish to communicate better with my teammates and wish I had spent more time doing tourism.
