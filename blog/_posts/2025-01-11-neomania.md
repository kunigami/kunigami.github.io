In his book, <a href="https://www.kuniga.me/books/the-art-of-thinking-clearly.html">The Art of Thinking Clearly</a>, Rolf Dobelli describes 99 psychological traps that humans tend to fall into. One of them is what he calls <i>Neomania</i>, the mania for the new.

In this post I'd like to share my <a href="{{blog}}/2024/12/02/centralizing-thoughts.html">thoughts</a> on it.

The reason for it being a trap (or more generally a negative thing) is that new things have a high chance of being irrelevant. We touched on this in [On Lifetime]({{blog}}/2023/07/10/on-lifetime.html), where we mention the book *Algorithms to Live By* [1], which says: an estimate for the lifespan of something we have no information about is twice its current age.

Thus, it's risky to invest time and energy on new things. Examples of neomania I can think of:

* Reading or watching the news
* Paying more for premieres
* Buying the latest Apple device or changing cars every few years
* Staying on top of the latest technology trends

### Neotrality

I believe I'm less affected by neomania than average. It's not that I make an effort to avoid new things nor that I think it's always best to do so, it's just my default mode. I decided to call it **neotrality**, a word play between the *neo* prefix (meaning new) and neutrality, as in being neutral to novelty.

If I had a more negative view towards it, I could used the term *neophobia*.

### News

On my review to [Real Analysis by Jay Cummings]({{blog}}/2023/04/21/review-real-analysis.html) [2] in 2023, I included a quote from the book:

> Thomas Jefferson revered Isaac Newton and once wrote to John Adams: "I have given up newspapers in exchange for Tacitus and Thucydides, for Newton and Euclid; and I find myself much happier."

And I mentioned:

> I haven't paid much attention to the news for a long time (well, except Hacker news) and in the past year or so found I enjoy reading history and math/physics a lot, so I have been focusing on those.

A big part of my neotrality to news is that I have a weird range of attention span: I can focus on texts that are one sentence (think of tweets or headlines) and books of hundreds of pages, but struggle reading things of length in between: I cannot recall the last time I read an entire article in a magazine or newspaper.

I also struggle to read blog posts (ironically, I'd have trouble reading my own posts). This is one medium I wish I could have more focus for.

Another downside of not reading the news is not having much material for small talk. I personally don't like small talk but sometimes it's useful for breaking awkward silences with strangers or acquaintances.

### The Latest Gadget

I got my first smartphone in 2012, the work phone provided by my company. It wasn't until many years later (2017?) that I bought my own smartphone but mostly because I wanted to develop on Android.

I wonder how long it would have taken me to get a smartphone had I not gotten one from my company.

I do save a lot of money by not buying the latest gadgets but there's also opportunity costs: I bought an iPad last year after visiting an Apple Store (it's such an effective marketing!) and wished I had done it sooner.

### The Latest Technology

In the book *The Code Breaker* [3], Walter Isaacson quotes Jack Szostak, Jennifer Doudna's PhD advisor:

> Never do something that a thousand other people are doing

I tend to agree to this and find that it's a lot harder to make a meaningful contribution in crowded areas.

Also, as I mentioned in [On Lifetime]({{blog}}/2023/07/10/on-lifetime.html):

>  I have a strong preference for building things that last

and relying on unproven technology often leads to throw-away exploratory projects which is not my forte.

In here too there are downsides, especially at work: I often have trouble staying on top of what other people are working on, which limits my ability to find new opportunities and project ideas.

## Conclusion

Overall I still find neotrality a net positive. It's easy to regret things in hindsight (*I wish I had bought the iPad sooner*) but it helps remembering there's a [survivorship bias](https://www.kuniga.me/books/the-art-of-thinking-clearly.html) at play: for every iPad I didn't buy, I also didn't buy other devices that would not have been useful. For each tech like LLMs there's web3 and blockchain.
