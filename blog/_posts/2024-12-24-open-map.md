This is the 9th post in the series with my notes on complex integration, corresponding to Chapter 4 in Ahlfors’ Complex Analysis.

In today's post we'll go over the *Open mapping theorem*, which states that if the domain of a non-constant holomorphic functions is open, then its image is open too.

## Formal Statement

The open mapping theorem states that if $f : \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is a non-constant holomorphic function, then for any open subset $Z$ of $\Omega$, the image $f(Z)$ is open.

We note that this property doesn't hold for the real case. For example, if we have $f(x) = x^2$, $x \in \mathbb{R}$, for the open interval $(-1, 1)$ we obtain the non-open interval $[0, 1)$.

An interesting thing about this theorem is that its proof relies on results that don't seem, at a first glance, related to open sets: the zeros of a function.

We'll now go over a few smaller lemmas that will lead to the open mapping theorem. Their proofs are hidden by default, but hopefully the lemmas statements give a good sense on the overall structure of the proof.

## Zeros

In the last post, we learned about [zeros and poles]({{blog}}/2024/11/02/poles.html). Turns out they play a key role in the open mapping theorem.

Recall that a zero of a function $f(z)$ is a value $z_0$ for which $f(z_0) = 0$. It has order $m$ if all the derivatives up to $m-1$ are also zero, i.e. $f^{(k)}(z_0) = 0$, but the $m$-th derivative is not, i.e. $f^{(m)}(z_0) \ne 0$.

We start with a Lemma that lets us factorize our function $f(z)$ in order to obtain another that is "zero-free".

**Lemma 1.** Let $f(z)$ be a holomorphic function in $\Omega$ and $z_1, z_2, \cdots, z_n$ be its zeros, and $m_1, m_2, \cdots, m_n$ their order.

Then $f(z)$ can be written as:

$$(1) \quad f(z) = (z - z_1)^{m_1}(z - z_2)^{m_2} \cdots (z - z_n)^{m_n} g(z)$$

Where $g(z)$ is a holomorphic function that is never 0.

<proof>

We use the result that holomorphic functions are analytic [2], and can thus be written as a Taylor series:

$$f(z) = c_0 + c_1 (z - a) + c_2 (z - a)^2 \cdots$$

for some disk centered in $a$. If we choose $a = z_1$, since $z_1$ is a zero of $f$, we have $f(z_1) = 0$ and thus $c_0 = 0$.
<br />
<br />
If $z_1$ has order greater than one, then $f'(z_1) = 0$. Differentiating the Taylor series:

$$f'(z) = c_1 + 2 c_2 (z - z_1) + 3 c_3 (z - z_1)^2 + \cdots$$

From $f'(z_1) = 0$ we conclude that $c_1 = 0$. We can repeat this process $m_1$ times to conclude that the first $m_1 - 1$ coefficients are 0:

$$f(z) = c_{m_1} (z - z_1)^{m_1} + c_{m_1 + 1} (z - z_1)^{m_1 + 1} + \cdots$$

So we can write

$$(1.1) \quad f(z) = (z - z_1)^{m_1} f_1(z)$$

for some holomorphic function $f_1(z)$. We claim that $f_1(z_1) \ne 0$. This is so because:

$$f^{(m_1)}(z) = m_1! f_1(z)$$

So if $f_1(z_1) = 0$, then $f^{(m_1)}(z_1) = 0$, implying that $z_1$ has order $m_1 + 1$, a contradiction.
<br /><br />
Now, given that $z_2 \ne z_1$, having $f(z_2) = 0$ implies that $f_1(z_2) = 0$ by $(1.1)$. Thus we use the same argument to conclude that:

$$f_1(z) = (z - z_2)^{m_2} f_2(z)$$

We can also see that neither $z_1$ nor $z_2$ are zeros of $f_2(z)$. Repeating up until $n$, should give us the desired result, where $g(z)$ has none of the zeros $z_1, z_2, \cdots, z_n$. It also should not contain any other zero $z'$, because it would imply that $f(z') = 0$.

QED
</proof>

This result reminds me of the [Fundamental theorem of algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra) in which a polynomial can be expressed as a product of its zeros.

## Winding Number

Recall that given a closed curve $\gamma$, the function $n(\gamma, a)$, the [winding number]({{blog}}/2024/05/09/the-winding-number.html) of $a$ with respect to $\gamma$, corresponds to how many times the curve $\gamma$ winds around the point $a \not \in \gamma$. If $\gamma$ is a simple closed curve (aka [Jordan curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_curve_theorem)), then $\gamma$ can wind around $a$ at most once, so $n(\gamma, a)$ can tell whether $a$ is inside ($n(\gamma, a) = 1$) or outside of $\gamma$ ($n(\gamma, a) = 0$).

We now make a connection between zeros and [winding numbers]({{blog}}/2024/05/09/the-winding-number.html):

**Lemma 2.** Let $f(z)$ be a non-constant holomorphic function in $\Omega$ and $z_1, z_2, \cdots, z_n$ be its zeros, and $m_1, m_2, \cdots, m_n$ their order. Let $\gamma$ be a closed curve in $\Omega$ and $n(\gamma, a)$ the winding number of a point $a$ with respect to $\gamma$. Let $\Gamma$ be the image of $f(\gamma)$. Then:

$$(2) \quad n(\Gamma, 0) = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} n(\gamma, z_i) m_i$$

<proof>

Let $w = f(z)$, so that $\frac{dw}{dz} = f'(z)$ or $f'(z)dz = dw$. Using change of variables we can write:

$$\int_\gamma \frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}dz = \int_\Gamma \frac{1}{w}dw$$

The definition of the winding number $n(\Gamma, 0)$ is [5]:

$$
n(\Gamma, 0) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{\Gamma} \frac{1}{z - 0} dw
$$

Thus:

$$
n(\Gamma, 0) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_\gamma \frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}dz = \sum_{i = 1}^n n(\gamma, z_i) m_i
$$

</proof>

Some comments about this result:

* The requirement that $f(z)$ is non-constant is so that $\Gamma$ is a closed curve. Otherwise it would degenerate into an isolated point.
* Recall that the winding number function returns integers, so all terms in equation $(2)$ involve integers.
* If we count a zero $z(a)_i$ inside $\gamma$, we account for all its orders (we can't have partial counts).

If $\gamma$ is a Jordan curve, we can interpret the equation as saying: the number of times $\Gamma$ winds around $0$ in the "$w$-plane" tells us how many of the zeros of $f(z)$ are contained inside $\gamma$ in the "$z$-plane".

Now, what if we replace $0$ by $a$ in $n(\Gamma, 0)$? What does $n(\Gamma, a)$ represent? It turns out it tells us how many values that make $f(z) = a$ are inside $\gamma$. So the result we obtained is just a special case for $a = 0$!

A more formal way to state this result is that $n(\Gamma, a)$ tells us how many of the zeros of $g(z) = f(z) - a$ are inside $\gamma$. So in a sense *Lemma 2* is invariant with translation:

**Lemma 3.** Let $f(z)$ be a non-constant holomorphic function in $\Omega$ and $z(a)_1, z(a)_2, \cdots, z(a)_n$ be the zeros of $f(z) - a$, and $m(a)_1, m(a)_2, \cdots, m(a)_n$ their order. Let $\gamma$ be a closed curve in $\Omega$ and $n(\gamma, a)$ the winding number of a point $a$ with respect to $\gamma$. Let $\Gamma$ be the image of $f(\gamma)$. Then:

$$
(3) \quad \sum_{i = 1}^n n(\gamma, z(a)_i) m(a)_i = n(\Gamma, a)
$$

<proof>
Let $g(z) = f(z) - a$. We can apply Lemma 2 for $g(z)$ to conclude:

$$
\sum_{i = 1}^n n(\gamma, z(a)_i) m(a)_i = \int_\gamma \frac{f'(z)}{f(z) - a} dz
$$

We have $g'(z) = f'(z) = dw/dz$, so doing a change of variables gives us:

$$
\int_\gamma \frac{f'(z)}{f(z) - a} dz = \int_\Gamma \frac{1}{w - a}dw = n(\Gamma, a) 2 \pi i
$$

Which shows that:

$$
n(\Gamma, a) = \sum_{i = 1}^n n(\gamma, z(a)_i) m(a)_i
$$


</proof>

Recall *Lemma 4* in *The Winding Number* [5], which claims that points in the same region (defined by $\Gamma$) share the same winding number. This means that if points $a$ and $b$ are in the same region with respect to $\Gamma$, then $\gamma$ contains the same number of zeros of $f(z) - a$ and $f(z) - b$, per *Lemma 3* above. More formally:

**Lemma 4.** Let $f(z)$ be a non-constant holomorphic function in $\Omega$, a Jordan curve $\gamma$ inside $\Omega$, and $z_0$ a point not in $\gamma$. Define $w_0 = f(z_0)$ so that $z_0$ is a zero of $f(z_0) - w_0$. Let $\Gamma$ be image of $f(\gamma)$.

Then there exists a disk $B = \curly{\abs{w - w_0} \lt \delta}$, $\delta \gt 0$ such that for any $a \in B$, $\gamma$ contains the same of number zeros of $f(z) - a$ as it does of $f(z_0) - w_0$.

<proof>

Because $z_0$ is not in $\gamma$, then $w_0$ is not in $\Gamma$, and since $\Gamma$ is a closed set, its complement is open and thus there exists a disk centered in $w_0$, $\abs{w - w_0} \le \delta$ that does not intersect $\Gamma$, which means all points in $B$ are within the same region defined by $\Gamma$.
<br /><br />
From <i>Lemma 4</i> in [5], we have that points in the same region (defined by $\Gamma$) share the same winding number. Thus we can conclude for any $a \in B$ the function $f(z) - a$ has the same number of zeros inside $\gamma$ as $f(z) - w_0$.

</proof>

Note that it doesn't mean that $f(z) - a$ and $f(z) - w_0$ have the same number of zeros, only that those inside $\gamma$ are the same.

Before we proceed to the open mapping theorem, let's take a quick detour and mention *Rouché's theorem*.

## Rouché's theorem

In the preceding section, we connected the number of zeros of two functions $f(z) - a$ and $f(z) - w_0$, as long as $a$ is sufficiently close to $w_0$. An alternative way to connect the number of zeros of two functions is by Rouché's theorem (which we won't prove here).

**Theorem 5.** (Rouché's theorem) Let $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ be holomorphic functions in a region $K$ and let $\delta K$ be its closed countour. If $\abs{g(z)} \lt \abs{f(z)}$ for $z \in \delta K$, then $f$ and $f + g$ have the same number of zeros inside $\delta K$.

Another way to state *Theorem 5* is that if we have $\abs{f(z) - g(z)} \lt \abs{f(z)}$ for $z \in \delta K$, then $f$ and $g$ have the same number of zeros inside $\delta K$.

We can use this theorem to obtain *Lemma 4*. Let $K$ be the region defined by $\gamma$ and its interior, so that $\delta K = \gamma$. Leg $g(z)$ in the theorem be our $f(z) - a$ and $f(z)$ in the theorem be our $f(z) - w_0$, so that $g(z) - f(z) = a - w_0$.

Like in *Lemma 4*, we assume that circle $B = \curly{\abs{w - w_0} \lt \epsilon}$ is contained in $\Gamma = f(\gamma)$. This means that for $z \in \gamma$, we have that $\abs{f(z) - w_0} \gt \delta$ because $f(z)$ lies outside $B$. We choose $a$ from inside $B$, which implies $\abs{a - w_0} \lt \delta$, so $\abs{f(z) - g(z)} \lt \abs{f(z)}$ and we can apply Rouché's theorem and we arrive at the same conclusion as *Lemma 4*.

End of the detour. Let's go back to proving the open mapping theorem.

## Open Mapping

Another way of saying "$\gamma$ contains a zero of the function $f(z) - a$" is to say $\gamma$ contains a value $z_a$ such that $f(z_a) = a$. What *Lemma 4* tells us is that if there some $b$ close enough to $a$, it's guaranteed that $\gamma$ also contains a $z_b$ such that $f(z_b) = b$! *Lemma 6* expands and formalizes this idea:

**Lemma 6.** Let $f: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ a non-constant holomorphic function in $\Omega$. Then for each $z_0 \in \Omega$, there exists an open disk $D = \curly{\abs{z - z_0} \lt \epsilon}$ (contained in $\Omega$) and an open disk $B = \curly{\abs{w - f(z_0)} \lt \delta}$ such that for every $a \in B$, there's a corresponding $z_a \in D$ for which $f(z_a) = a$.

<proof>
In <i>Lemma 4</i>, we assume $\gamma = D$, so it says there exists a open disk $B = \curly{\abs{w - w_0} \lt \delta}$ such that for all $a \in B$, $f(z) - a$ has the same number of zeros in $D$ as does $f(z) - w_0$.  Since $z_0$ is a zero of $f(z) - w_0$, there's at least one zero of $f(z) - w_0$ in $D$ and thus of $f(z) - a$ in $D$. Let $z_a \in D$ be such that $f(z_a) = a$.
</proof>

In other words, the inverse image of $B$, $f^{-1}(5)$, is contained in $D$, which in turn implies that $B$ is contained in $f(D)$. Since $D \subseteq \Omega$, then $f(D) \subseteq f(\Omega)$, thus $B \subseteq f(\Omega)$. So for every $w_0 \in f(\Omega)$, there is $z_0$ such that $f(z_0) = w_0$, which implies that there exists an open disk around $w_0$ contained in $f(\Omega)$ which implies $f(\Omega)$ is open.

This proves the *open mapping theorem*:

**Theorem 7.** (Open Mapping Theorem) A non-constant holomorphic function maps open sets to open sets.

## Refined Analysis

Now let's take a closer look at the nature of $f(z)$, in particular in the case where its image is a disk, as we have considered in *Lemma 6*.

In *Lemma 6*, we chose an open disk $D = \curly{\abs{z - z_0} \lt \epsilon}$ such that it contains *at least* one zero of $f(z) - w_0$, in that case $z_0$. It's possible there are other values for which $f(z) = w_0$, but we can shrink $D$ enough to make sure $z_0$ is the *only* zero. Let $m$ be the order of $z_0$.

If $m = 1$, *Lemma 8* shows that locally, $f(z)$ is a bijective and conformal function:

**Lemma 8.** Let $f(z)$ be a non-constant holomorphic function in an open disk $D$ centered at $z_0$, with $z_0$ being the only zero of $f(z) - w_0$, and of order 1.

Then there exists an open disk $B$ centered in $w_0$ such that $f$ is a bijection between $f^{-1}(5)$ and $B$. For this domain, $f$ is also conformal, and $f^{-1}$ is holomorphic.

<proof>

Let $g(z) = f(z) - w_0$. Since $m = 1$, by definition $g'(z_0) \ne 0$ and we have that $g'(z_0) = f'(z_0)$. This also means that $n(\Gamma, 0) = 1$ and so is $n(\Gamma, a)$ for $a \in B$, which means only one $z_a$ exists in $D$ such that $f(z_a) = a$. Since we count the order of zeros in $n(\Gamma, a)$, it implies that $z_a$ has order 1, and thus that $f'(z_a) \ne 0$.

We conclude that $f(z)$ is a bijection because for every $a$ in $B$ there's exactly one $z_a$ in $f^{-1}(5)$. Since $f'(z) \ne 0$ for all $z \in f^{-1}(5)$, by *Theorem 3* in [7] that $f$ is conformal map in $f^{-1}(5)$. It can also be shown, via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_function_theorem#Holomorphic_inverse_function_theorem">Holomorphic inverse function theorem</a> that $f^{-1}$ is holomorphic at $f^{-1}(5)$. Summarizing as a corollary:

</proof>

For the case where $m > 1$ the function is not as simple, but we can decompose it into two: a bijective function and a simple power function:

**Lemma 9.** Let $f(z)$ be a non-constant holomorphic function in an open disk $D$ centered at $z_0$, with $z_0$ being the only zero of $f(z) - w_0$, and of order greater than 1.

Then there exists a bijective and conformal function $\xi(z)$ such that

$$(4) \quad f(z) - w_0 = \xi(z)^m$$

<proof>
We have that $z_0$ is the only zero of $f(z) - w_0$ and has order $m$, so we can use <i>Lemma 1</i> to obtain:

$$
(9.1) f(z) - w_0 = (z - z_0)^m g(z)
$$

Where $g(z)$ is a holomorphic function that has no zeros in the open disk $D$. Now consider $g(z)^{1/m}$. This is a multi-valued function, but we can obtain a single valued one via branch cutting [8]. The branch cut we use is the usual negative real axis. So as long as the $g(z)$ doesn't intersect the branch cut, we can pick an arbitrary branch of $g(z)^{1/m}$.
<br /><br />
Since $g(z)$ is holomorphic, it's also continuous. To recap, that means that for any $\epsilon \gt 0$, there exists $\delta \gt 0$ such that $\abs{g(z) - g(z_0)} \lt \epsilon$ for all $\abs{z - z_0} \lt \delta$. In other words, we can make the difference $\abs{g(z) - g(z_0)}$ arbitrarily small by shrinking $\delta$. In particular, if we set $\epsilon = \abs{g(z_0)}$, we can guarantee that:

$$\abs{g(z) - g(z_0)} \lt g(z_0)$$

This effectively indicates that $g(z)$ doesn't cross the real-axis and thus avoids the branch cut. We can thus pick an arbitrary branch $h(z) = g(z)^{1/m}$ which is single valued and holomorphic.
<br /><br />
Now we define $\xi(z) = (z - z_0)h(z)$, which is holomorphic. We have that $\xi(z)$ is not constant because $\xi'(z) = h(z)$ and since $g(z) \ne 0$, $h(z) \ne 0$. Finally we have that $\xi(z_0) = 0$. So we can apply <i>Lemma 8</i> for $f(z) = \xi(z)$ and $w_0 = 0$, to conclude that there's an open disk $B'$ centered at the origin such that $\xi(z)$ is a bijection between $\xi^{-1}(B')$ and $B$.
<br /><br />
By replacing the definition of $\xi$ in $(9.1)$ we obtain $(4)$.
</proof>

We can visualize what $w = f(z)$ does in the case $m \gt 1$. We'll actually consider the inverse function, so we express $z$ as function of $w$ via:

$$z = \xi^{-1}((w - w_0)^{1/m})$$

We know that $\xi^{-1}$ is holomorphic and conformal from *Lemma 9*. Consider a disk centered in $w_0$ of radius $\delta$ in the $w$-space. Let's observe what happens to a set of points along a ray from the center, as shown in Figure X (a).

Consider the function $\psi(w) = (w - w_0)^{1/m}$. Which first takes the disk to the origin $(w - w_0)$ and then applies the $n$-th root which has the effect of creating $m$ regions on a disk of radius $\delta^{1/m}$, which we depict in Figure X (b).

Then to obtain $z$ by applying $\xi^{-1}$, which is a bijection and conformal, so it will preserve the regions and the angles, but might not preserve overall shapes, as shown in Figure X (c).

## Conclusion

The open map theorem is simple to state but non-trivial to prove. It relies on several concepts and results from previous posts, namely zeros and winding numbers.

It took me quite a while to go through this section of Ahlfors's book, especially the "visualization" of *Lemma 9*. It helped to study *multi-valued functions* first [8].

## Appendix

**Lemma 10.** Let $f(z)$ be a holomorphic function in $\Omega$ and $z_1, z_2, \cdots, z_n$ be its zeros, and $m_1, m_2, \cdots, m_n$ their order. Let $\gamma$ be a closed curve in $\Omega$ and $n(\gamma, a)$ the winding number of a point $a$.

Then:

$$
(5) \quad \sum_{i = 1}^n n(\gamma, z_i) m_i = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{\gamma} \frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}dz
$$

<proof>

First we apply the logarithm to $(1)$ we get:

$$\ln f(z) = m_1 \ln (z - z_1) + m_2 \ln (z - z_2) + \cdots + m_n \ln (z - z_n) + \ln g(z)$$

Differentiating:

$$\frac{d \ln f(z)}{dx} = \frac{m_1}{z - z_1} + \frac{m_2}{z - z_2} + \cdots + \frac{m_n}{z - z_n} + \frac{d \ln g(z)}{dz}$$

We can use the logarithmic derivative identity:

$$
\frac{d \ln f(z)}{dz} = \frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}
$$

for both $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ to obtain:

$$
\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} = \paren{\sum_{i = 1}^n \frac{m_i}{z - z_i}} + \frac{g'(z)}{g(z)}
$$

We integrate this expression over the curve $\gamma$:

$$
(2.1) \quad \int_\gamma \frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} dz = \int_\gamma \paren{\sum_{i = 1}^n \frac{m_i}{z - z_i}}dz + \int_\gamma \frac{g'(z)}{g(z)}dz
$$

Since $g'(z)$ is holomorphic and $g(z) \ne 0$ from <i>Lemma 1</i>, then $g'(z)/g(z)$ is holomorphic and from Cauchy's Integral Theorem [4] we have that

$$\int_\gamma \frac{g'(z)}{g(z)}dz = 0$$

Swaping the sum and integral in $(2.1)$ gives us:

$$
\int_\gamma \frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} dz =\sum_{i = 1}^n \int_\gamma \frac{m_i}{z - z_i}dz
$$

Moving the constant $m_i$ out of the integral and dividing by $2\pi i$:
$$

\frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_\gamma \frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} dz =\sum_{i = 1}^n \frac{m_i}{2\pi i} \int_\gamma \frac{1}{z - z_i}dz
$$

Using the definition of winding number

$$n(\gamma, a) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_\gamma \frac{1}{z - a}dz$$

we obtain:

$$
\frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_\gamma \frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} dz =\sum_{i = 1}^n n(\gamma, z_i) m_i
$$
