Over the years, I have used a few social networks for sharing content I wrote: Facebook (closed to friends and colleagues), Twitter (prior to the rebrand to X) and more recently on [Mastodon](https://mathstodon.xyz/@kunigami) and [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@kuni.gami).

It bothers me a bit to have them spread out across multiple platforms and worse, subject to their fate and whims. I'd like to centralize them and in a medium I have more control of. My personal website seems like an ideal place for this.

The major downside is distribution since most people don't follow blogs nowaways. To address that, I plan to have the bulk of content here and post summaries with links in my social networks. I already do that to a large extent for new blog posts, and have more recently started a page with [summaries of books](https://www.kuniga.me/books/) I read and that I share in places like [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11286207-guilherme).

There are many other less-technical topics I would like to write about, but in which I'm far less versed in. I'm always debating whether I should post them alongside my technical posts or have a dedicated page like I do for books. For now, I'm sticking with the latter. In fact, I just publicized a page on [fine arts](https://www.kuniga.me/amuseum/).

There is, however, a type of non-technical post I do plan to include in my blog, which I call *shower thoughts*. These are just random ideas I think about from time to time. I already posted some of them under the tag "[opinion](https://www.kuniga.me/blog/tags/#opinion)" but I would like to write more of them. In [On Memory](https://www.kuniga.me/blog/2022/12/27/on-memory.html) in particular, I wrote:

>  I've historically just written these in private documents, but decided to write a public post for the added benefit of spending more time thinking about it and making it more clear in general.

I still need a forcing function to make such posts, because otherwise I keep waiting until I have enough to write about them and it never happens. I'll experiment with posting one such post every quarter.
