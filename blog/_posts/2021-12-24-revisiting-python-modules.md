This is a post in the series on revisiting Python. I've been using Python for a long time but most of my learning has been organic and on-demand. By actively studying its parts we might learn to do things in better way, or help us understand why our code does not work the way we would expect in corner cases.

In the [previous post]({{blog}}/2015/03/08/revisiting-python-object-oriented-programming.html) we talked about *Object Oriented Programming*, and in this we'll discuss the modules system.

This was been tested with Python 3.9 (this post might receive updates when newer versions make it obsolete).

<!--more-->


## The Module Object

A module has a 1:1 mapping to a file, as described in [1]:

> A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py appended.

There's an exception to this rule which we'll see later.

When we import a module with `import`, it adds an object of the built-in class `module` to the current scope:

{% highlight python %}
import math
print(type(math)) # <class 'module'>
{% endhighlight %}

### Module Type

I don't know if this distinction is used in any official documentation but to me it's helpful to categorize a module into:

* **built-in** - part of the interpreter. Example: `sys`
* **library** - a system-level library (corresponding to `.so` files on Linux/Mac). Example: `math`
* **file** - regular Python file. Example: `inspect`
* **package** - corresponds to a directory, and can be divided into **namespace** and **regular** (see *Packages*). Example: `importlib`

They're all abstracted behind a `module` but we can see they return different things for `inspect.getfile()`:

{% highlight python %}
import sys
import math
import inspect
import importlib

# built-in
# TypeError: <module 'sys' (built-in)> is a built-in module
print(inspect.getfile(sys))

# library
# '/usr/local/.../python3.9/lib-dynload/math.cpython-39-darwin.so'
print(inspect.getfile(math))

# file
# '/usr/local/.../python3.9/inspect.py'
print(inspect.getfile(inspect))

# package
# '/usr/local/.../python3.9/importlib/__init__.py'
print(inspect.getfile(importlib))

{% endhighlight %}



### Module Name

The module object has the property `__name__`, that matches the module name. Note that if we alias the module on importing `__name__` contains the original name, for example:

{% highlight python %}
import math as new_math
print(new_math.__name__) # math
{% endhighlight %}

There is also a built-in variable, `__name__`, that is the name that corresponds to the module name where it lives, for example, if we have a file called `lib.py`:

{% highlight python %}
print(__name__) # lib
{% endhighlight %}

When we run the file using `python`, the variable  `__name__` is overridden to `"main"`, which is leveraged in a common technique to gate code to only run when called as the entry point file. For example, if we have `app.py`:

{% highlight python %}
if __name__ == 'main':
    print('entry point')
{% endhighlight %}

The message will only be printed if we executed it as `python app.py`, but will not if it's included as a module in some other file.


### Import Cache

A module is only imported once, which means that the file corresponding to that module is only executed one time. The modules are cached in the `sys.modules` variable.

This means it's possible to hijack that variable to stub a module. Suppose in `lib.py` we have:

{% highlight python %}
import math

def f():
    return math.sin(1)
{% endhighlight %}

And that we have a custom `math_mock.py` module:

{% highlight python %}
def sin(x):
    return 0.55
{% endhighlight %}

Then in `main.py` we can replace the `'math'` module:

{% highlight python %}
import math_mock
import sys

sys.modules['math'] = math_mock

# it's important we set sys.modules before this
import lib
print(lib.f()) # 0.55
{% endhighlight %}

This can be used for example to mock an entire module during tests.

### 'This' Module

Combining the knowledge from the two previous sections, it's possible to access the module object of the current file via [2]:

{% highlight python %}
import sys
this_module = sys.modules[__name__]
{% endhighlight %}

### Inspecting Modules

In [1] it states:

> Each module has its own private symbol table, which is used as the global symbol table by all functions defined in the module

We can see the list of variables defined in a given module using the `dir()` function:

{% highlight python %}
import math
print(dir(math))
"""[
    '__doc__',
    '__file__',
    '__loader__',
    '__name__',
    '__package__',
    '__spec__',
    'acos',
    'acosh',
    ...
]"""
{% endhighlight %}

Note that this only returns the names. If we're also interested in the instances corresponding to the names, we can use `inspect.getmembers()`, which returns a list of tuples (name, instance):

{% highlight python %}
import math
print(inspect.getmembers(math))
{% endhighlight %}

It's worth noting that both `dir()` and `inspect.getmembers()` are APIs that work with any class instance, and are not specific to modules.

For completion, it's worth noticing modules also have the `__dict__` attribute, which contains a dictionary of name -> instance:

{% highlight python %}
import math
print(math.__dict__)
{% endhighlight %}

For modules `x.__dict__` seems to be equivalent to `inspect.getmembers(x)` but in general this is not always true [3, 4].

## Flavors of Import

There are a few different ways of importing a module and they might have different semantics.

### Import Module Object

Let's consider the syntax used so far:

{% highlight python %}
import math
{% endhighlight %}

As we said before, this adds the `math` object to the current scope, which really is a reference to a structure in memory. This means we can modify the module contents in runtime, for example, we could override `math.sin`:

{% highlight python %}
import math

def custom_sin(x):
    return 0.0

math.sin = custom_sin

print(math.sin(0.3))  # 0.0
{% endhighlight %}

Not only will calls to `math.sin()` use the new implementation, code in other modules using `math.sin` will also be affected. For example, if we have in `lib.py`:

{% highlight python %}
def f():
    print(math.sin(0.5))
{% endhighlight %}

And then in `main.py`:

{% highlight python %}
import math
import lib

def custom_sin(x):
    return 0.0

math.sin = custom_sin

print(lib.f()) # 0.0
{% endhighlight %}

Needless to say this can lead to very confusing behavior. It could be interesting for mocking in tests though.

### Import Module Parts

Another syntax for importing is via:

{% highlight python %}
from math import sin
{% endhighlight %}

This is more or less equivalent to:

{% highlight python %}
import math
sin = math.sin
{% endhighlight %}

Note that if you override the implementation of `sin`, it simply updates the memory the variable `sin` points to, and not the object `math` in any way. So if `main.py` is:

{% highlight python %}
from math import sin
import math

def custom_sin(x):
    return 0.0

sin = custom_sin

print(sin(0.3))  # 0.0
print(math.sin(0.3)) # .29552020666
{% endhighlight %}

Note that `math.sin()` wasn't affected.

### Import All

We can import all definitions from a module with this syntax:

{% highlight python %}
import * from math
# imported from math
sin(1)
{% endhighlight %}

This is convenient but it can also become problematic for more complex codebases, for example, if the same name is defined in multiple modules.

### Import From Strings

We can import a module from a string via the `importlib.import_module` function:

{% highlight python %}
import importlib
lib = importlib.import_module('lib')
print(lib) # <module 'lib' from ...
{% endhighlight %}

We'll see an use case for this in *Lazy Loading Modules* below.

## Searching for modules

When deciding which directory to search for a file corresponding to a module, the modules loader will look for a list of paths in order. This list can be obtained via:

{% highlight python %}
import sys
sys.path
{% endhighlight %}

This itself is initialized from the environment variable `PYTHONPATH`. When we run Python via a `python file.py`, the first entry of `sys.path` is the directory of `file.py`, which allows for local imports without further setup, for example when we import `lib.py` in `main.py` like above:

{% highlight python %}
import lib
{% endhighlight %}

Note that the modules loader will not search the directory recursively, so if we have `foo.py` in this structure:

{% highlight text %}
/
| main.py
| sub_dir/
   | foo.py
{% endhighlight %}

Then importing with in `main.py` like:

{% highlight python %}
import foo
{% endhighlight %}

Will not work. We'll cover subdirectories in the next section.

## Packages

A **package** is a collection of modules like in [1]. It's roughly a 1:1 map to a directory. It can be divided into **regular** and **namespace** packages.

Continuing from the prior example, the correct way to import a file under a directory `sub_dir` is via:

{% highlight python %}
import sub_dir.foo
print(sub_dir.foo) # <module 'sub_dir.foo' ..
{% endhighlight %}

In this case `sub_dir` is considered a package since it contains all the modules corresponding to files under its directory.

Note that the `.` replaces the `/` and that this works with multiple depths. For example to import `sub_dir/another_dir/bar.py` we do:

{% highlight python %}
import sub_dir.another_dir.bar
print(sub_dir.another_dir.bar)  # <module 'sub_dir.another_dir.bar'...
{% endhighlight %}

This causes the name of the imported module to be quite long, so we can use the `from ... import` syntax:

{% highlight python %}
from sub_dir.another_dir import bar
print(bar) # <module 'sub_dir.another_dir.bar' ...
{% endhighlight %}

We can import the subdirectory-only instead of its module, for example:

{% highlight python %}
import sub_dir
print(sub_dir) # <module 'sub_dir' (namespace)>
print(sub_dir.foo) # <module 'sub_dir.foo' ..
{% endhighlight %}

As we see in the output, this is considered a **namespace** module/package [5], which means it doesn't have an associated file.

### Regular Packages

Before Python 3.3 it used to be necessary to include a file `__init__.py` for files in subdirectories to be "visible". It's still possible to do so. For example, we could have the following structure:

{% highlight text %}
/
| main.py
| sub_dir/
   | __init__.py
   | foo.py
{% endhighlight %}

The code in `__init__.py` is executed when it or any of its subdirectories are imported. Suppose it has:

{% highlight python %}
import math
print('i am sub_dir')
a = math.sin(1)
{% endhighlight %}

If we import it in `main.py`:

{% highlight python %}
import sub_dir # executes code in sub_dir/__init__.py
print(sub_dir) # <module 'sub_dir' ...
{% endhighlight %}

Note that `sub_dir` is not a *namespace* module anymore since it's tied to `sub_dir/__init__.py`, but rather a **regular** one. Further, the variables in the scope of `__init__.py` are available for importing:

{% highlight python %}
from sub_dir import math, a
{% endhighlight %}

### Import All Modules!

As in the case with a single module, we can use the `*` syntax:

{% highlight python %}
import * from sub_dir
{% endhighlight %}

The behavior will depend on whether `sub_dir` has a backing `__init__.py` or not. If it does, only the variables in the scope of `__init__.py` will be imported.

The package owner can explicitly control what gets imported when doing the `*` import by defining the variable `__all__` in `__init__.py`:

{% highlight python %}
__all__ = ["baz"]
{% endhighlight %}

Now, when we do in `main.py`:

{% highlight python %}
import * from sub_dir
{% endhighlight %}

We'll see only the module `baz` has been imported even if other variables were defined in `__init__.py`. If a `__init__.py` is missing, nothing is imported.

### Intra-package Imports

We can use a relative import syntax within a package. Suppose we have this structure

{% highlight text %}
/
| main.py
| lib.py
| sub_dir/
    | another_dir/
        | bar.py
        | baz.py
    | foo.py
{% endhighlight %}

In `bar.py` we can import module relative to the package `sub_dir`:

{% highlight python %}
from .bar import f
from ..foo import g
{% endhighlight %}

Note that only the syntax `from <module> import <def>` is allowed in this case. The number of dots represent the number of steps up in the file tree take, starting from 0.

We can't import modules outside the package, so for example, if we had this in `bar.py`:

{% highlight python %}
from ...lib import f
{% endhighlight %}

It would fail, because `lib.py` is not in the package `sub_dir`.

## Performance

When we run `python main.py`, all its dependencies are recursively imported and their top level code are executed. For example, consider a file `lib.py`:

{% highlight python %}
a = very_expensive_function()

def my_func():
    print(a)

{% endhighlight %}

When we include it in `main.py`:

{% highlight python %}
from lib import my_func

if rare_event():
    my_func()
{% endhighlight %}

Note that `very_expensive_function()` will be executed even if we rarely or never use `my_func()` in `main()`. In an ideal world the author of `lib.py` should not execute expensive code in the top level but this is hard to control.

This can lead to pretty high start up times for scripts and CLI tools which is a common use case for Python. One option is to lazy load these modules as we'll see next.

### Inlining Imports

The most straightforward way to avoid overhead is by inlining the import as needed, so our `main.py` would look like:

{% highlight python %}
if rare_event():
    from lib import my_func
    my_func()
{% endhighlight %}

which addresses the issue. Recall that module loader only imports modules once so having to inline the import is safe:

{% highlight python %}
if rare_event():
    from lib import my_func
    my_func()

if another_rare_event()
    from lib import my_func
    my_func()
{% endhighlight %}

In the example above, even if both conditions end up returning true, we'll only execute the code of `lib.py` once. One major downside of this approach is having to add the `import` statement in multiple places which can be tedious and error prone.

We now consider an option with lighter syntax.

### Lazy Loading Modules

We can use `importlib.util` to define a function that takes the name of a module as a string and returns a module whose file won't execute until one of its members is accessed. [6] provides the following implementation (which I'm surprised it's not part of the API):

{% highlight python %}
import importlib.util
def lazy_import(name):
    spec = importlib.util.find_spec(name)
    loader = importlib.util.LazyLoader(spec.loader)
    spec.loader = loader
    module = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)
    sys.modules[name] = module
    loader.exec_module(module)
    return module
{% endhighlight %}

Which we can then use as:


{% highlight python %}
lib = lazy_import('lib')

if rare_event():
    lib.my_func()
{% endhighlight %}

The downside of this approach is that we need to load the module name via string which might make static checkers unable to check whether the module actually exists or catch issues during file renaming, etc.

The documentation in [6] suggests using lazy loaded modules only when strictly necessary:

> For projects where startup time is critical, this class allows for potentially minimizing the cost of loading a module if it is never used. For projects where startup time is not essential then use of this class is heavily discouraged due to error messages created during loading being postponed and thus occurring out of context

How do we know which modules to lazy load? We'll see next.

### Detecting Expensive Modules

We can determine which module is taking the most time to import by running our binary with the `-X importtime` flag. As an experiment, I tried profiling a recent project I worked with [t-digest](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/tdigest):


{% highlight text %}
make env
./env/bin/python -X importtime tdigest/tdigest.py
{% endhighlight %}

It prints a tree-like structure as text, which is a bit hard to make sense of. Fortunately there are UI tools to better visualize this trace, for example [tuna](https://github.com/nschloe/tuna):

{% highlight text %}
pip install tuna
{% endhighlight %}

We can save the output of the profiler to a file and visualize it in the browser:

{% highlight text %}
make env
./env/bin/python -X importtime tdigest/tdigest.py 2> /tmp/import.log
tuna /tmp/import.log
{% endhighlight %}

The result is in Figure 1.

## Conclusion

As always, focusing in learning one topic and setting time aside to play around led me to learn many new things. Some of them like the "self module" don't seem immediately useful but knowing they exist could be handy in the future.
