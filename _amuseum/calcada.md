Calçada is a pavement made our of small pieces stone to arranged in geometric patterns, much like Roman mosaics. This tradition started in Lisbon, Portugal, in the 19th century.

It eventually spread to former Portuguese colonies, including Brazil. One of the most popular motifs are the waves in black and white, which was originally used as homage to the Portuguese navigation.

Fun fact: Sidewalk is called calçada in Brazil.


While reading articles on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_pavement) to learn more about calçadas, I learned of many places outside of the typical Portuguese cultural sphere of influence (i.e. its former colonies), that has them. One is in Hayward, around the San Fracisco Bay Area.

Another one is at the museum of the Portuguese immigrant. There was a significant wave of immigration from Azores after an earthquake hit the island in the 1950s.
