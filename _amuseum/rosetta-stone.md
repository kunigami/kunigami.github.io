The Rosetta Stone contains the same text written in three different versions: ancient egypian in hieroglyphic script, in demotic script and in ancient Greek. This stone allowed scholars to decipher egypian hieroglyphs.

It was written in 196 BC during the Ptolemaic kindgom of Egypt and much later was used as building material to a fort near the town of Rashid, or Rosetta, and discovered by a soldier during the Napoleon's incursion in Egypt.

The British defeated the French in 1801 and took the stone with them, which is now displayed at the British museum and is the most visited artifact there.
