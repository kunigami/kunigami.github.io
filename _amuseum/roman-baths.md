The Roman Baths in Bath, Somerset were public bathing built during the Roman empire occupation of Britain around 60 AD and were used until the 5th century AD.

Archaeological evidence suggests it was a Celtic worship center before that, to the god Sulis which the Romans associated with Minerva.

After the Romans left, the place fell into disrepair but was restored over the centuries.
