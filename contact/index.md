The most reliable way to reach out is by email. My address is my last name at the gmail.com domain.

If you want to make suggestions to blog posts or pages, including fixing typos, feel free to open an issue on [Github](https://github.com/kunigami/kunigami.github.io) or send a pull request. My whole site is open-source!

For the fun of it, I also have an emoji domain: my last name @📨.to (I check this one way less often).
