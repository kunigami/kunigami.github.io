## Partial Derivative

Suppose $f(x, y)$ is a function of two real variables. Then the partial of derivative $f$ with respect to $x$, denoted by $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ is defined as

$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x + h, y) - f(x, y)}{h}$$

In LaTex we can use the `\partial` command for the "curly d".
