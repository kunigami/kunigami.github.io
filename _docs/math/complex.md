## Real and Imaginary parts

Let $z = a + ib$ for $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$. $a$ is the real part of $z$ and denoted by $\Re(z)$. $b$ is the imaginary part of $z$ and denoted by $\Im(z)$.

## Conjugate

Let $z = a + ib$ for $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$. The conjugate, denoted by $\bar{z}$ is defined as $z = a - ib$.

Some identities:

$$\Re(z) = \frac{z + \bar{z}}{2}, \qquad \Im(z) = \frac{z - \bar{z}}{2i}$$
