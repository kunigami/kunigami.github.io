### Radius of convergence

Let a power series be defined as:

$$f(z) = \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} {c_n} (z - a)^n$$

For complex coefficients $c_n$, contant $a$ and variable $z$. The radius of convergence is a non-negative real $r$ or $\infty$ such that:

* If $\abs{z - a} > r$, the power series diverges
* If $\abs{z - a} < r$, the power series converges

The name *radius of convergence* alludes to the fact that $\abs{z - a} = r$ is a circle of radius $r$ in the complex plane, and that inside that circle the power series converges.
