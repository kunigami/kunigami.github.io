## Family of Sets

Let $I$ be a set. For each $\alpha \in I$, let $A_\alpha$ be a subset of a given set $S$.
$S$ be a set. We call $I$ the **indexing set** and the set of $A_\alpha$ the **indexed family of subsets of** $S$ and denoted by $\curly{A_\alpha}_{\alpha \in I}$.

This notation let's us express operations with an arbitrary (possibly infinite) number of terms, for example, the union of all $\curly{A_\alpha}\_{\alpha \in I}$ can be denoted as $\cup_{\alpha \in I} A_\alpha$.
