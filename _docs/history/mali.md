In 1464, Sonni Ali declared himself emperor of the Songhai empire and conquered Timbuktu (1468) and Djenne (1475). In 1492 he died and was succeeded by his son, who was soon deposed by one of his father's generals, Askia the Great, in 1493.

Askia the Great reigned until 1528. Several monarchs succeeded from this dynasty up to Askia Daoud, up to Askia Ishaq II. During his reign, the [Morrocan](https://www.kuniga.me/docs/history/morocco#saadi-dynasty-1549---1659) al-Mansur invaded the Songhai empire.
